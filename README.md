1. Project's title.

The title of this project - "Online store Chanel".

2. Project Description.

2.1. MOTIVATION
 My motivation for this project consists in importance of online-stores.
And such brand as Chanel includes different categories of products, which we can display for student's frontend developer's project.
Also attractive photos of Chanel's product are useful for beautyful design of the project.

2.2. TECHNOLOGIES
The project was complicated by using React 18.2.0.

Navigation between components was acheived through react-router-dom 6.21.3.

For using "footer" in the project was used such library of CSS-patterns, as Bootstrap 4.3.1 and React Bootstrap 2.10.0.

The opportunity of using cart, count products, adding products to cart, summing total price and removing products from cart became real through React Redux 9.1.0. 

As UI example was used Sweetalert2 11.10.4.

2.3. CHALLENGES AND PROBLEMS

At work of the project I faced to next problems:

- errors with imports during work with Redux;
- on the page "Shop" of the online-store of this project firstly you can see products from category "Fragnance",
because this category was selected as state in slice of Redux. It was made for selection categories.
- problems with CSS using footer by Bootstrap for React;
- impossible to make CSS of sweet alert more adaptive for projects design;
- problems with counting products without using Redux;
- errors with functionality Redux;
- problems with CSS for the best design;
- impossibility to make the project real, for example using user's accounts and order's checkout 
through lack of some knowledges.

So my main challenge is to work more with Redux, CSS and to continue get new information to become good frontend developer.

3. Table of Contents.
