        title: "“MAY MY LEGEND PROSPER AND THRIVE. I WISH IT A LONG AND HAPPY LIFE!",
        description: "Gabrielle Chanel lived her life as she alone intended. The trials of a childhood as an orphan and the successes of an accomplished businesswoman gave birth to an extraordinary character; daring, free, and ahead of her time. Faithful friendships and passionate love affairs, as well as a thirst for culture, discovery and travel helped shaped her personality. A wardrobe freed from constraints and superfluity, tweaked with masculine accents, created a visionary allure that has become timeless and yet wildly modern.",

        title: "LAUNCH OF CHANEL N°5 PERFUME",
        description: "1921 year - Launch of the first CHANEL perfume: N°5. This women’s perfume which smells like a woman, revolutionary due to its composition, name and presentation, was born out of Gabrielle Chanel’s partnership with perfumer Ernest Beaux.Even before it debuted, Chanel No. 5 caused a stir. Chanel hosted a party for some of her most fashionable friends, sprayed the perfume around the table, and, according to legend, was asked about the scent by every woman who passed by. The fragrance was an immediate hit, considered to be “cleaner” than many of the most common perfumes but also more “mature” and adult, in keeping with Chanel’s public image. Now considered by many to be the first modern perfume, Chanel No. 5 is as recognizable and enduring as Chanel’s most famous clothing designs, and the designer herself.",

        title: "GABRIELLE CHANEL IN HOLLYWOOD",
        description: "In 1931, Chanel didn’t need Hollywood. Hollywood, however, needed Chanel. Or so thought movie mogul Samuel Goldwyn, who ran United Artists. He believed that “women went to movies to see how other women dressed,” according to A. Scott Berg in his 1989 biography, Goldwyn. Film designers, unlike couturiers, were really theatrical costumers, whose designs, it was widely felt, “lacked elegance and mimicked fashion without being so itself,” in the words of film scholar Kristen Welch. As movie audiences dwindled after the Wall Street crash of 1929, Goldwyn was looking for new ways to bring in moviegoers—especially women.",

        title: "ARRIVAL OF KARL LAGERFELD IN 1983",
        description: "Karl Lagerfeld is named Artistic Director of CHANEL. He brought life back into the Cruise collections, introduced the Métiers d'art and pre-collections, restored Haute Couture to its former glory, and created the CHANEL Ready-to-Wear collection as we know it today.When Lagerfeld stepped into the role of creative director at Chanel, the storied fashion house was on the brink of bankruptcy. By modernizing the interlocking CC logo and altering the house’s signature aesthetic, the designer established Chanel as a timeless, iconic, and revenue-generating brand around the world. Whether it was through the tweed suit or quilted-chain bag, Lagerfeld spent his Chanel years revisiting classic designs with each collection he sent down the runway, cementing his legacy along the way.",
